# Snowman Game

Â© 2017 Dominic V. Lacroix

Simple hangman-style game re-packaged for the holidays as a disappearing snowman.

This project uses React components, state management and local storage to keep a record of previous game statistics. The game picks a random topic/word combination each time a new game starts.

The snowman is built using CSS only and is a mofified version of the snowman created by [Ali Khalilifar](https://codepen.io/alikhalilifar/pen/CcHqg?page=1&) on CodePen.

The snow animation was created by [Nicky Christensen](https://codepen.io/NickyCDK/pen/AIonk) and also shared on CodePen.

Enjoy and Good Luck!
